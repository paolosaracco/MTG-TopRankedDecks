<h1 id=goals>Goal of the project</h1>

*Magic: The Gathering* (aka MTG) is a well-known collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. The MTG World Championships (Worlds) is among the most important tournament in the game, offering cash prizes of up to $100,000 to the winners. We wonder whether winning decks in the standard format have a particular combination of different card types. To answer the question in the negative, we compare the number of Land, Creature, Instant and Sorcery, and Other card types in the top 4 decks of each World Championship from 1994 until 2022.
